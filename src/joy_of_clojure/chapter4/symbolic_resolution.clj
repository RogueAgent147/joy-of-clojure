(ns joy-of-clojure.chapter4.symbolic-resolution)

;; symbols aren't unique based on their name alone

(identical? 'goat 'goat)

;; the name is above is a symbolic representation but that name is
;; the basis for symbol equality

(= 'goat 'goat)

;; identical? only ever returns true when the symbols are the
;; same object:

(let [x 'goat
      y x]
  (identical? y x))

;; metadata

(let [x  (with-meta 'goat {:ornery true})
      y (with-meta 'goat {:ornery false})]

;; Like keywords, symbols donâ€™t belong to any specific namespace
