;; must be a vector The second arg can be any sequence.
;; you can view the operation of into as similar to an O(n)
;; concatenation based on the size of the second argument
;; vector can't be concatenated any more efficiently than O(n)



;; Clojure can store primitive types inside of vectors using the vector-of function
;; which takes any of :int , :long , :float , :double , :byte , :short , :boolean , or :char
;; as its argument and returns an empty vector

;; LARGE VECTORS
;; when collections are small the performance difference between vectors and lists hardly matter.
;; Vectors are particularly efficient at three things
;; relative to lists: adding or removing things from the right end of the collection, accessing
;; or changing items in the interior of the collection by numeric index, and walking
;; in reverse order.

;; any value in a vector can be changed using the assoc function.
;; clojure does this essentially in constant time using structural sharing between the old and new
;; vectors

(assoc a-to-j 7 "take me and pour me out")

;; A few higher-powered functions are provided that use assoc internally.

;; an existing value, it takes a function to apply to an existing value.

;; 5.2.3 vectors as stacks

;; Classic stacks have at least two operations, push and pop.
;; With respect to Clojure vectors,
;; these operations are called conj and pop , respectively. The conj function adds
;; elements to, and pop removes elements from, the right side of the stack.
;; Consequently, peek becomes more important as the primary way to get an item from
;; the top of the stack:

(def my-stack [1 2 3])
(peek my-stack)
(pop my-stack)
(conj my-stack 4)
(+ (peek my-stack) (peek (pop my-stack)))
(- (peek my-stack) (peek (pop my-stack)))

;; Each of these operations completes in essential constant time.
;; Most of the time, a vector thatâ€™s
;; used as a stack is used that way throughout its life.
;; If the algorithm involved calls for a stack, use conj , not assoc , for
;; growing the vector; peek , not last ; and pop , not dissoc , for shrinking it.


;; 5.3.4 Using vectors instead of reverse

(defn strict-map1 [f coll]
  (loop [coll coll acc nil]
    (if (empty? coll)
      (reverse acc)
      (recur (next coll)
             (cons (f (first coll)) acc)))))

(strict-map1 - (range 5))

;; This is adequate code, except for that glaring reverse of the final return value.
;; After the entire list has been walked once to produce the desired values, reverse walks it
;; again to get the values in the right order. This is both inefficient and unnecessary.
;; one way to get rid of this reverse is to use vector instead of list as the accumulator.

(defn strict-map2 [f coll]
  (loop [coll coll, acc []]
    (if (empty? coll)
      acc
      (recur (next coll)
             (conj acc (f (first coll)))))))

(strict-map2 - (range 7))


;; 5.2.5 Sub-vector
;; clojure provides a fast way to take a slice of an existing vector such as a-to-j

(def a-to-j (vec (map char (range 65 75))))
a-to-j
(time (get a-to-j 4))
(subvec a-to-j 3 6)
(subvec a-to-j 2 5)
(def tru (subvec a-to-j 2 5))
(time (get tru 1 ))

;; The new sub-vector internally hangs on to the entire original
;; a-to-j vector, making each lookup performed on the new vector cause the sub-vector
;; to do a little offset math and then look it up in the original.

;; 5.2.6 Vectors as maps entries

(first {:width 20 :height 30 :depth 15})

;; But not only does a map entry look like a vector it is really one

(vector? (first {:width 20 :height 30 :depth 15}))

;; This means you can use all the regular functions on it: conj get, and so on.

(doseq [[dimension amount] {:width 10 :height 20 :depth 15}]
  (println (str (name dimension) ": " amount " inches")))
