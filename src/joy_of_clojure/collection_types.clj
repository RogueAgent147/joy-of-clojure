;; A sequential collection is one that holds a series of values without reordering them.
;; A sequence is a sequential collection that represents a series of values that may or
;; may not exist yet.
;; Clojure has a simple API called seq for navigating collections


;;  Clojure classifies each collection data type into one of
;; three logical categories or partitions: sequentials, maps, and sets

;; sequentials -> list, vectors and java list such as java.util.Arraylist.
;; the other partition are set or map
